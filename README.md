# Tw33pi
Simple Twitter Bot I made in python to try the tweepy library.
its a very simple example of twitter bot with python.
(I might consider making it its own account or re-deploy it on heroku)
Currently what he does:
- unfollow inactive accounts you follow
- follow back when followed
- randomly retweet about your interrests (if tweet got a certain number of likes)
- likes random tweets about your interests
